	<h1>I want to drive!</h1>
	
	<p>
		Here is the manual for the players who want to drive in Speed Dreams <b>1.4.0</b>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		First of all you should install and run Speed Dreams ; for that, please read see the
		INSTALL file <a href="http://speed-dreams.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/speed-dreams/trunk">here</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		After that you'll be able to drive a car with a joystick, a steering wheel, or simply with the mouse and/or keyboard.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		You first need to configure a "human player" in order to choose you car and control device(s) : 
		go to the Player Configuration menu.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/welcome-playerconfig.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		To select a player to configure, click in the "Players" list box on one player's name. 
		You can also :
		<ul>
			<li>create a new player through the New button under the list box (all default settings),</li>
			<li>copy the selected one with the Copy button (all his settings will be copied, you'll then need to give him a new name),</li>
			<li>delete the selected one with the Delete button.</li>
		</ul>
	</p> 
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/playerconfig-select.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Here, we have selected the player named "Player". 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		To change his name, click in the "name" field and edit it with usual keys.
	</p>
		<img src="images/playerconfig-editname.jpg">
	<p>
		Tip: If you do not want to come back later to change the car / control settings,
		create here multiple players with different cars / control settings ...
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This configuration screen is also used to:
		<ul>
			<li>Select the player's car:
				<ol>
					<li>First select the car's category you want:
						<ul>
							<li><b>36 GP</b>: These terrible Grand-Prix cars of the thirties</li>
							<li><b>Supercars</b>: The ones you dream of, in their unmodified version</li>
							<li><b>TRB1</b>: The Speed Dreams setups of the well known GTs from Torcs</li>
							<li><b>LS-GT1</b>: The future awesome Speed Dreams GT1 series</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Then select your car within the category.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Select the transmission mode (automatic, sequential or grid)</li>
				<ul>
					<li><b>automatic</b>: Just throttle down or brake, the computer takes car of the gears</li>
					<li><b>sequential</b>: Shift up and down like in a F1 car</li>
					<li><b>grid</b>: Enjoy the good old grid shifter, like grand father's</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Program the number of pit stops you want for the race, so the initial fuel amount is adjusted accordingly.</li>
			<li>Change the player's skill level:
				<ul>
					<li><b>Rookie</b>: No damages (0%),  high traction (+40%)</li>
					<li><b>Amateur</b>: Small damages (50%),  high traction (+35%)</li>
					<li><b>Semi-Pro</b>: Medium damages (80%), medium traction (+30%)</li>
					<li><b>Pro</b>: High damages (100%), low traction (+0%)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Select the auto reverse function (engage automatically the reverse gear when the car is stopped and you continue to brake).</li>
			<li>Configure the control device(s) (see below)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<h1>Player's Control Configuration</h1>
	
	<p>
		To configure the controls click on the "Controls" button
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/playerconfig-control.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Now, click on the control you want to change ...
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/controlconfig-autoseq.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		... and then press the keyboard key you want to use for that control, 
		or a mouse button if you prefer, or even ... move the mouse
		if that control have to be assigned to a mouse move event.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Tip: To unassign a given control, click on it and press the Escape key.
	</p>
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/controlconfig-mouseleft.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
 		You can also use a joystick, a gamepad, or even a wheel with/without pedals/gear lever ...
		See <a href="http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/joystick/">the Vojtech Pavlik's joystick
		driver site</a> for more information on how you can have your device work under Linux.
		(see also <a href="http://www.icculus.org/lgfaq">Linux Gamers FAQ</a>).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The control configuration screen is a bit different if you choosed the grid shifting mode,
		but it works the same way.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/controlconfig-wheelright.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Tip: If your device was not plugged in (you forgot), just exit 
		from the control configuration screen, plug it in, and then get back ...
		This time it should work.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Proceed with all the controls you want to configure (you can use device buttons, axes, ...).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Then you probably want to calibrate the relevant axes.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/controlconfig-calibrate.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Just follow the calibration instructions on the screen.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/joystickconfig.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The calibration screen is a bit different when you choosed the mouse.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/mouseconfig.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		When the calibration is done, press the "back" button. If something went wrong
		during the calibration process, don't panic, use the "reset" button to start over
		the calibration.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		You'll have to save your control settings before exiting (unless you want to cancel all through the Cancel button).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/controlconfig-save.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		And then save the players settings (or Cancel all of your changes through the Cancel button).
	</p>

	<h1>General Configuration Options</h1>
	
	<p>
		You can configure general options using the "Options" menu
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/welcome-options.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>The Graphic parameters are located in the "Graphic" menu</p>
	<p>
		<img src="images/options-graphic.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>The following parameters are customisable:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Visibility</b>: The depth of view factor (> 0), you can go beyond 100%</li>
	<li><b>Smoke</b>: The number of smokes per car (>= 0)</li>
	<li><b>Skid Marks</b>: The number of skid marks per car (>= 0)</li>
	<li><b>LOD Factor</b>: The cars LOD (Level Of Detail) threshold (>= 0.0)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As a general rule for all these parameters, greater values will need a more powerfull system : play a little to find the ones that fit best your hardware</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/graphic-accept.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The screen display configuration is done in the "Display" menu
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/options-display.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		You can adjust the screen / window resolution, the colour depth,
		the display mode (windowed or fullscreen), the video initialization mode
		("compatible" normally works, while best may produce odd graphic effects ...).
	<p>
		Use the Apply button to validate your changes. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<b>Note:</b> If the program does not restart with the parameters you have chosen, 
		don't panic, just edit the "screen.xml" file and reset the values 
		to a more conservative choice (this file is normally located in ~/.speed-dreams/config under Unixes, or <My documents>/speed-dreams.settings/config under Windows).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<b>Advanced:</b> Under Windows, you can also set the maximum screen refresh rate (Hz)
		during the game : if your real hardware screen refresh rate is 75 Hz,
		it's useless (no harm, only warm and noise ;-) to use a higher value
		as your CPU will work for nothing. Under Linux, use your video driver configuration
		tool and set the "Sync to VBlank" option to get the same effect.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<img src="images/display-accept.jpg">
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If you are experiencing problems with the mouse cursor, you can try to launch TORCS with the option "-m".
		And if you have texture problems, you can try the "-s" option to run in single texture mode.
	</p>
