Changes since 2.0.0 Alpha 3 released in 2.0.0 Beta 1.
-----------------------------------------------------
This release was build from SVN https://speed-dreams.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/speed-dreams/tags/2.0.0-b1@3937.

The rework of the parameters of all our cars is nearly done, there is only some tweaking needed about the Supercars to keep them drivable by the robots.
The robots setup rework has been started, but only the Simplix 36 GP are done (plus the Simplix LS1 Archer R9 and the Kilo2008 TRB1 Cavallo).
The reflexions on cars were made more shiny.
Many many new / HQ reworked cars liveries (skin, interior, tires, ...).
Some few HQ improvements on tracks.
Preview menu backgrounds and HQ fonts.

  - wider 3rd screen in 3-way split screen,
  - split screen configuration is now saved / restored between races.
* D13 : Dual-threaded race engine with CPU affinity 
  (can be toggled on/off in the Options / Simulation menu)
  First tests show FPS gains mainly when many opponents on medium to high end configurations,
  but CPU affinity seems to be very usefull under Windows XP (nearly no use with Linux 2.6).
* D19 : Rain simulation (visual effects + work in progress grip management)
* Customizable weather / time of day for the sky dome

Simulation engines:
* D48 : Work in progress Simu v2.1 (same a Simu V2 for the moment)
* Simu V3 won't be adopted as the official physics engine : we'll improve Simu V2
  into Simu V2.1 in the short 2.x term, while targetting at a brand new Simu V4
  in the medium term.

Other:
* D04 : CMake build system
* D03 : Replaced GLUT by SDL
* D16 : New "Career" race mode
* D17, D26 : Work in progress network/online race mode
* Improved keyboard steering behaviour (+ customizable sensitivity)
* D05 : Added JPEG image support for car and tracks previews in menus.
* D06 : Removed compile time dependency on ALUT
* Moved Windows build to modern DLL interface (no more .def files)
* D11 : Support for multiple cars with same 3D model .acc/.ac file
* D08 : Work-in-progress code profiling
