2.0.0 Alpha 1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release was build from SVN https://speed-dreams.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/speed-dreams/tags/2.0.0-a1@2720.

Tracks:
* A32, A16, A17, A19, A22, A24 : HQ texture rework + renaming + localization
  for Alpine-1 (=> Allondaz), GTrack3 (=> Charmey), Manton (=> Michigan Speedway),
  ETrack6 (=> Espie), ERoad (=> Prenzlau)
* Texture improvements + localization : Aalborg, Forza, Forza, Migrants, Ruudskogen, 
  Corkscrew, Olethros Road, Wheel1
* Texture improvements : GTrack1, Brondehach
* new Goldstone Sand (Silverstone Arena) track
* many new work-in-progress tracks (won't be all in 2.0.0, only release grade ones)

Cars:
* T01 : Work in progress LS1 setups rework
* A10 : Work in progress LS1 liveries HQ rework
* A05, A06, A08 : Improved visual realism / HQ for SC Cavallo 360
* A14 : Work in progress Rally car set (draft-level physical setups)
* A42 : Work in progress MP5 (was GP 1600) car set
* improved car model file/folder names consistency

Robots:
* D16 : Adapted Simplix and USR to the new Career mode
* Simplix improvements

Menus:
* D30 : Player Config and sons :
  - removed player car choice (becomes a race-time choice)
  - added customizable steering speed sensitivity
* D29, D30 : Driver Select and sons (D29 & D30) :
  - added skin selection and preview (may only remain for human players in the future)
    Note: Only one car has previews for the moment : SC Lynx 220.
  - added "Car Selection and Settings" menu behind the "Change car" button,
    with skin selection and preview + quick car data sheet
    (work in progress : hard coded constant Overall ratings)
* Options : added options to customize Simulation and Graphic features

Race engine / screen:
* Display average frame rate in the race screen
* Spit screen mode (multiplayer) : 
  - 'TAB' key switches to active screen,
  - sound follows the active screen selection consistently,
  - wider 3rd screen in 3-way split screen,
  - split screen configuration is now saved / restored between races.
* D13 : Dual-threaded race engine with CPU affinity 
  (can be toggled on/off in the Options / Simulation menu)
  First tests show FPS gains mainly when many opponents on medium to high end configurations,
  but CPU affinity seems to be very usefull under Windows XP (nearly no use with Linux 2.6).
* D19 : Rain simulation (visual effects + work in progress grip management)
* Customizable weather / time of day for the sky dome

Simulation engines:
* D48 : Work in progress Simu v2.1 (same a Simu V2 for the moment)
* Simu V3 won't be adopted as the official physics engine : we'll improve Simu V2
  into Simu V2.1 in the short 2.x term, while targetting at a brand new Simu V4
  in the medium term.

Other:
* D04 : CMake build system
* D03 : Replaced GLUT by SDL
* D16 : New "Career" race mode
* D17, D26 : Work in progress network/online race mode
* Improved keyboard steering behaviour (+ customizable sensitivity)
* D05 : Added JPEG image support for car and tracks previews in menus.
* D06 : Removed compile time dependency on ALUT
* Moved Windows build to modern DLL interface (no more .def files)
* D11 : Support for multiple cars with saùe 3D model .acc/.ac file
* D08 : Work-in-progress code profiling
