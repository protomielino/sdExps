* #307 Merged version.h and config.h into the only remaining config.h,
  for simplicity + renamed the speed-dreams project to speed-dreams-2
* Add DL library in tgf link-time dependencies (needed for Mageia 1 or 2 Alpha)

       Game restart after display options change now always works properly

                         =====================================================

Changes since 2.0.0 Alpha 2 released in 2.0.0 Alpha 3
-----------------------------------------------------
This release was build from SVN https://speed-dreams.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/speed-dreams/tags/2.0.0-a3@3412.

We started the most important work for 2.0 : a full rework of the parameters
of all our cars, towards realism (as for parameter values as for the handling).
This also implies reworking the robots setups for the cars, which is work-in-progress.
The weather simulation was also made more stable and user-friendly in many ways.
The race choice / configuration menu system was also improved.
And cars and tracks got even more HQ sugar.

Known bugs (yes, there are ;-)
* Career mode : no human driver seems to be able to join, at least at the beginning
* Installer : the base installer fails to run any of the other installers the first time ;
  simply re-run it and this time it will work.
