* new Goldstone Sand (Silverstone Arena) track
* many new work-in-progress tracks (won't be all in 2.0.0, only release grade ones)

Cars:
* T01 : Work in progress LS1 setups rework
* A10 : Work in progress LS1 liveries HQ rework
* A05, A06, A08 : Improved visual realism / HQ for SC Cavallo 360
* A14 : Work in progress Rally car set (draft-level physical setups)
* A42 : Work in progress MP5 (was GP 1600) car set
* improved car model file/folder names consistency

Robots:
* D16 : Adapted Simplix and USR to the new Career mode
* Simplix improvements

Menus:
* D30 : Player Config and sons :
  - removed player car choice (becomes a race-time choice)
  - added customizable steering speed sensitivity
* D29, D30 : Driver Select and sons (D29 & D30) :
  - added skin selection and preview (may only remain for human players in the future)
    Note: Only one car has previews for the moment : SC Lynx 220.
  - added "Car Selection and Settings" menu behind the "Change car" button,
    with skin selection and preview + quick car data sheet
    (work in progress : hard coded constant Overall ratings)

* Display average frame rate in the race screen
* Split screen mode (multiplayer) : 
  - 'TAB' key switches to active screen,
  - sound follows the active screen selection consistently,
  - wider 3rd screen in 3-way split screen,
  - split screen configuration is now saved / restored between races.
* D13 : Dual-threaded race engine with CPU affinity 
  (can be toggled on/off in the Options / Simulation menu)
  First tests show FPS gains mainly when many opponents on medium to high end configurations,
  but CPU affinity seems to be very usefull under Windows XP (nearly no use with Linux 2.6).
* D19 : Rain simulation (visual effects + work in progress grip management)
* Customizable weather / time of day for the sky dome

Simulation engines:
* D48 : Work in progress Simu v2.1 (same a Simu V2 for the moment)
