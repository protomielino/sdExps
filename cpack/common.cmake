"Speed Dreams is a free and open source motorsport simulator. Originally a
fork of the TORCS project, it has evolved into a higher level of maturity,
featuring realistic physics with tens of high-quality cars and tracks to
choose from.

Speed Dreams features multiple categories from all racing eras (36GP
and 67GP, Supercars, Long Day Series 1/2, and many more), 4
computer-controlled driver implementations, flexible race configuration
(real-time weather conditions, multi-class races, etc.), as well as a
master server to compare your best lap times against other players."
