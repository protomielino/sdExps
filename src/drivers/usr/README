The origins of this robot began with Andrew melding the raceline logic from 
Remi's K1999 and the framework code from Berniw's BT into a new bot, "locus",
which was designed to provide a competitive entry-level codebase for the 
annual TRB championship.

After a break of several years, in 2015 Andrew began with a copy of the locus 
code and started a series of hacks & tweaks to improve its laptimes and its
ability to overtake, resulting in the USR and Axiom robots you see today.
