This robot is based on "Mouse", created by Tim Foden and entered in the
TRB World Championship in 2006 and 2007.  That robot was derived from 
"Sparky" and "Dodger", which were developed by Tim for TORCS's precedessor 
RARS.

I've fixed a few bugs, especially returning to the raceline after a spinout
and a few problems with pitting, and also enhanced its ability to drift
around corners and its decision making when overtaking.

Andrew Sumner, 2009.

Its the same old story. Nobody cares for a robot. Just wind him up, turn
him loose, and grease him every thousand miles.
