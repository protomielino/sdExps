# Speed Dreams

![Speed Dreams logo](./doc/readme/sd-logo.png)

Speed Dreams is a free and open source motorsport simulator. Originally
a fork of the [TORCS](https://torcs.sourceforge.net/) project,
it has evolved into a higher level of maturity, featuring realistic physics
with tens of high-quality cars and tracks to choose from.

> **End users are expected to download the pre-built packages listed below.**

## Pre-built packages

Speed Dreams binaries are available for the following platforms:

- Debian/Ubuntu (TODO)
- Microsoft Windows (TODO)

## Building from source

In-tree builds (i.e., including both code and data on the same build)
are recommended for simplicity. To achieve this, update the
[`speed-dreams-data/`](./speed-dreams-data/) submodule with:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Otherwise, CMake will search the `speed-dreams-data` package on a
well-known location, or rely on the
[`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.html)
variable to search for an **installed** version of the `speed-dreams-data`
package, which must then be indicated when configuring the project:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path-to-speed-dreams-data> # other args...
```

Nonetheless, there is also the [`freesolid`](./freesolid/) submodule that might
be required since that project has not been packaged by most distributions yet.
In such case, update the submodule with:

```
git submodule update --init freesolid
```

> **The steps below will assume in-tree builds unless noted otherwise.**

Once configured as described below, the project can be built with:

```
cmake --build build/ # Optionally, add -j8 or any other number for faster builds
```

Optionally, the project can be installed via:

```
cmake --install build/
```

### BSDs, Linux

Speed Dreams can be built from source using the conventional build process
in CMake projects:

```
cmake -B build
```

### Windows

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/#latest) `3.12.0` or newer
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/) `8` or newer (for the track editor)
- [MinGW](https://winlibs.com/), with support for C++11.

> Please ensure these tools are added to the `%PATH%` environment variable.

On Windows, dependencies cannot be fetched from a package manager as in
conventional Linux distributions. To solve this, Speed Dreams defines
[a separate build system for third-party dependencies](./packaging/3rdParty-devel/).
This would build all dependencies from source, so they can be later found
by CMake.

> **Both methods described below will require the path to the pre-built**
> **dependencies**.
> Please read [the instructions](./packaging/3rdParty-devel/README.md)
> for further reference.

#### Native builds

If building from Windows, append the path to the pre-built dependencies to
the
[`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.html)
variable:

```
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path-to-dependencies>
```

If using MinGW, then the `MinGW Makefiles` CMake generator might have to be
manually selected:

```
cmake -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path-to-dependencies>
```

#### Cross-compiling from Linux

Speed Dreams can not only be compiled natively from Windows, but can be also
cross-compiled for Windows from a fully free (as in freedom) operating
system like GNU/Linux. The
[`w64-mingw32`](https://git.code.sf.net/p/mingw-w64/mingw-w64)
toolchain can be used for the cross-compilation, with dedicated
toolchain files for
[`i686-w64-mingw32`](./packaging/3rdParty-devel/i686-w64-mingw32.cmake)
and
[`x86_64-w64-mingw32`](./packaging/3rdParty-devel/x86_64-w64-mingw32.cmake),
referred to by the
[`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE.html)
variable. Third-party dependencies are then referred to by the
[`CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH.html)
variable, as intended for cross-builds.

> **`CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH` must be an absolute path.**

##### `x86_64`

```
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=packaging/3rdParty-devel/x86_64-w64-mingw32.cmake -DCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH=<path-to-dependencies>
```

#### `i686`

```
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=packaging/3rdParty-devel/i686-w64-mingw32.cmake -DCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH=<path-to-dependencies>
```

### Dependencies

#### Debian/Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt install git cmake build-essential libopenscenegraph-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev librhash-dev libenet-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libminizip-dev libopenal-dev libplib-dev libexpat1-dev libcjson-dev openjdk-17-jdk openjdk-17-jre
