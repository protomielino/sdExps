Robots:
-
- enabled Simplix and USR robots to be members of mixed teams,
  through new team management interface in RobotTools (Wolf-Dieter)
- added Kilo robots (needs more love) (Gabor)

Menus:
- added controls for time of the day and weather settings in quickrace
  and practice race configuration menu - work in progress (Xavier)
- added a "Credits" multi-page menu to list all contributors, contributions
  and 3rd party libs / code / software we use.
- resurected the "Configure player" button in the Raceman menu, to avoid returning
  to the Main menu for that (Jean-Philippe).
- select the first available player by default when entering the player config menu
  (Brian).

Program:
- applied the good old SDL patch from Brian Gavin (Xavier)
- fine tuning of the event loop to process ALL pending events
  before re-displaying (fixes lags and delays in mouse movements) (Jean-Philippe).
- fixed localized keyboard support through SDL unicode (Jean-Philippe, Brian, Mart)
- fixed splash screen crash on 7s time-out (Jean-Philippe)
- added F1 / F12 / ESC / Return shortcuts in some menus where lacking (Jean-Philippe)
- fixed detection and use of multi-sampling (for anti-aliasing)
  when available (Jean-Philippe)
- restored key auto-repeat in menus (Jean-Philippe)
- restored texture compression detection (Jean-Philippe)
- applied Cmake patch by Mart Kelder and ported it to Windows (Mart, Brian)
  * smart cmake multi-platform build system (even Windows + MSVC built-in support),
  * speed-dreams and other programs are now executables (no more scripts)
    which is nicer for debugging/profiling/... 
  * very fast unified make install (no more so slow make install and make datainstall)
- added multi-platform xmlversion user settings files installer at run-time,
  to replace old system where these files where overwriten after each build/install
  even if no associated change had occurred (Mart, Jean-Philippe).
- fix build install system not stopping on xmlversion errors
  (ex: when a versioned xml file is not loadable, it's installation/update fails,
       cmake printed some error lines, but the install process was not stopped,
       and if you didn't see these lines in the hundreds of other traces,
       you were likely to get a crashing Speed Dreams without any simple explaination).
- fixed CPU slow-down system also activated in race mode (Jean-Philippe)
- added new sky dome and time of day simulation via PLIB::ssgaSky,
  featuring really nice skies, even at night with stars and moon,
  and also allowing night races as an example - work in progress (Xavier)
- first attempt of rain simulation (water projections behind tires, rainbow visualization,
  reduced grip) - work in progress (Xavier)
- fixed ultra-slow game in qualification blind mode (something around SDL IdleFunc,
  seems CPU does nothing whereas it should run 100%)  (Jean-Philippe)
- fixed results not being saved at the end of the race because results dir
  not created in user settings dir; and also screenshot system not working
  for the same reason (screenshot dir not created) (Gabor).
- optimized race results' update & sorting through the use of STL vector (Gabor).
- race results now include pointer how much position the driver gained or lost,
	from his starting position (Gabor).
- merged career-port to this branch (Mart)
- don't load graphics in results-only mode (Mart)
- added split times (Mart)
- added 10 second stop and go penalty (Mart)
- added feature lists for robots: features are only enabled when all the robots in the
  race implemented it (Mart)
- added timed sessions (Mart)

- new modes for the race screen leader board (Gabor)
  * vertically scrolling : list of competitors, text in associated color,
  * horizontally scrolling : just as on TV.
  Note: Already merged in trunk.
- new mode for the debug board (Gabor)
  * display segment name, distance form start, current camera
- exhaust fires shown when RPM drops (Gabor)
